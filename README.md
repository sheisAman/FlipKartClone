# FlipkartClone
Learning by Cloning!

## Description
A responsive clone of a well known e-commerce website Flipkart, using frontend tools - HTML and CSS.

## Intuition
When learning a new subject, whether it be Web Development or basket weaving, it makes sense that new learners start at an atomic level. In the case of Web Development, learning begins with page definition tools such as HTML5 and CSS, prior to transitioning to learning processing languages such as Javascript or Python.

Initial steps such as these follow a bottom-up approach to the learning. This is a natural starting point since it is only logical that fundamental knowledge must be learned before it will be possible to progress to more complicated topics. For example, knowing Javascript is a prerequisite for learning React.

Most, if not all, new Web Developers find the leap from understanding how individual tools and technologies work, like CSS and HTML, to being able to integrate their use to be a difficult leap. Luckily, cloning existing websites is a learning technique that bridges the atomic understanding of individual parts and pieces into a holistic understanding.

## WorkFLow
• Proceded by creating a blueprint to define what activities are needed, the order they should be performed in, and
at what level of detail makes getting started easier.
• Grouped components which together supply a specific piece of functionality to a user.
• Further Working upon Js to demonstrate static features like add product to cart, remove from cart,
increase quantity in cart, search product etc.
